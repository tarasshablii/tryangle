ðŸ§© How to Play TryAngle
Welcome to TryAngle â€“ the game of dots, lines, and sneaky triangles!

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Pick a board size, and whether you want to play against a friend or challenge a cunning AI creature (from wiggly worm to
wise owl ðŸ¦‰).

You and your opponent will take turns connecting two dots with a line. But waitâ€”
ðŸ‘‰ Lines canâ€™t cross other lines or pass through dots. So plan ahead!

Make a triangle? Boom!

You claim it with your pastel player color

You score points (based on how big your triangle is)

You get to go again!

Bonus move: If your triangle eats a smaller one inside it, you steal their score. Triangle politics.

Captured dots inside triangles get greyed outâ€”theyâ€™re off-limits now.

Game ends when:

Someone owns more than 50% of the board

OR no more moves are left and itâ€™s a draw

No hints, no undos, just your wits and some dots.
Can you out-triangle your opponent?
